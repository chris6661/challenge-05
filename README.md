# Work Day Scheduler 
## This scheduler can be used to track any events through out the workday and has both the time and date stamp at the top of the page (something small for help with staying on track through your day!).
### This is a daily schedule reminder to utilize through out the average 9-5 workday, utilizing color coordination to determine the importance of tasks that need to be completed. If the color is green, then the time block is in the next hour from the current time (if it is 9:00 AM, 10:00 AM and on will be color coded green), if the color is red, the time block is the present hour you are in (if the time for a task is 9:30 AM and it is placed at 9:15 AM, the time block from 9AM-10AM will be red), and if the color is gray then that time block will have already passed for the day, however it can be utilized for the next day (if the current time is 3:00 PM and an even is scheduled for 10:00 AM; the time block will remain gray since the time has passed for the day; however the next day the 10:00 AM hour will be green). As mentioned previsouly, the date and time every day is set using moment.js and displays the number day of the month, month, year, and time of day as well down to the second.
